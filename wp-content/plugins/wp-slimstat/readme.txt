== Changelog ==

= 4.3.6 =
* [New] In the last few weeks we've been working on revamping the Settings screens, by turning those boring radio buttons and text areas into more polished and modern switches and sortable tag lists. No more separating values with commas, when creating blacklists or configuring access control lists. Now you can type values as tokens, drag and drop them to reorganize your lists, and easily delete values. Pleae note: we had to rename some class variables to streamline our codebase, so if you're referencing them in your code, make sure to use the new names to avoid errors. Please report any issues or concern to our [support team](http://support.wp-slimstat.com).
* [New] A few users have experienced a conflict between AdBlock (and friends) and our stylesheet and javascript files. Apparently an overzealous ad blocker can prevent our assets from loading, thus showing [a quite messy interface](https://slimstat.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/12000000414-the-reports-are-not-being-rendered-correctly-or-buttons-do-not-work). A notice has been added to the plugin and it will be displayed if this behavior is detected (thank you, [acekin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/interface-questions)). 
* [Update] New versions of our premium add-ons will be released in the next few hours, to update the compatibility to the latest version of Slimstat. If you are not upgrading the main plugin, please DO NOT upgrade the add-ons.
* [Update] Introduced some PHP code optimizations to the tracker. Readability has also been improved, by retrofitting our existing code and applying our style guide to it.
* [Update] [AmCharts Map](https://www.amcharts.com/javascript-maps/), the library used to render our geolocation map, has been updated to version 3.20.9.
* [Update] Language files now contain all the new strings introduced in the last few updates. Please consider contributing to the project by submitting a translation in your language.
* [Fix] Multiple data purges were being scheduled under certain circumstances.

= 4.3.5 =
* [New] The slim_events table is now being archived along with the main slim_stats table.
* [Update] qTip2 and SlimScroll jQuery libraries have been updated to version 3.0.3 and 1.3.8 respectively.
* [Fix] The "out" timestamp was not being archived, when data was being copied over to the archive table.
* [Fix] Fixed an issue with HTTPS and Cloudflare when enqueueing the javascript tracker (thank you, [wuboys](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/use-admin_url-without-second-parameter))
* [Fix] Some more fields in the settings could not be reset to an empty value, if a non-empty value had been set (thank you, [codx26](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slimstat-not-displaying-any-type-of-stats-after-switching-from-temporary-url)).

= 4.3.4 =
* [Update] [Browscap](http://browscap.org/) library updated to version 6015, released on June 20th, 2016.
* [Fix] WordPress had changed a global variable we use in our code, and made it 'protected' (thank you, [chrisl27](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slimstat-uses-wpdb-dbname-instead-of-wpdb-prefix))
* [Fix] Some fields in the settings could not be reset to an empty value, if a non-empty value had been set (thank you, Christian)
* [Fix] Switching the menu position in the settings from Sidebar to Admin Bar was returning a permission error (thank you, [janiesc](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/cant-move-menu-position-to-admin-bar))
* [Fix] Download links with query string appended at the end of their URL were not being tracked as expected (thank you, [willfretwell](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/tracking-downloads-3)).

= 4.3.3 =
* [New] The tracker can now record more than one outbound link per pageview. The corresponding reports have been updated to keep the new column structure into consideration when calculating the values. (thank you, [john](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/external-link-tracking-replace-with-another-link))
* [Update] The default method for determining the browser from the user agent string will now be our proprietary heuristic function, not browscap anymore. If needed, you can change this under Settings > Tracker tab.
* [Fix] A PHP warning was being returned after tracking a click event on an internal download (thank you, [Stephen S](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-notice-undefined-var-data_js)).
* [Fix] The new version of Browscap bundled with Slimstat 4.3.2 was causing quite a few 500 Server Error messages for our users. The nature of the issue remains unclear, however we decided to roll back to the previous version of the data file, which was working without any problems.
* [Fix] Adding a trailing comma to some of the text settings could trigger unexpected behaviors in the tracker. (thank you, [paronomasiaster](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slimstat-not-recording-hits))

= 4.3.2.3 =
* [Note] Thanks to our user Boris, we were able to clarify some license issues with our partner IP2Location. We look forward to extending the functionality implemented by our IP2Location add-on to offer a better user experience, especially when exporting the data.
* [Fix] When checking for spammers, if our Custom DB add-on was enabled, the plugin was generating a SQL error (thank you, [SGURYGF](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/custom-db-issue))

= 4.3.2.2 =
* [Note] Just a quick note to let you know that we will be focusing on a major project in the next few weeks, so both development and customer support might be less responsive than usual. Please be patient, and refrain from submitting the same request more than once. Thank you!
* [New] Slimstat now speaks Belarusian thanks to Natasha from [UStarCash](https://www.ustarcash.com/).
* [Fix] Bug in Javascript tracker with Async mode enabled was duplicating entries in the Access Log.
* [Fix] Variable type mismatch was preventing scheduled posts from publishing (thank you, [Salpertriere](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/latest-version-stops-scheduled-posts-from-publishing?replies=5#post-8365376))
* [Fix] Some Javascript strings (used to generate the charts) where not correctly encoded and were breaking the source code in certain localizations.

= 4.3.2.1 =
* [Fix] Some static text ( var_ ) sneaked into the source code. Apologies for the inconvenience.

= 4.3.2 =
* [Note] We are working on a new add-on, Slimstat Sentinel, which will alert you if suspicious activity is detected on your website. Stay tuned.
* [New] Added support for "current post/page" to shortcodes. Now you won't need to write any PHP code to show, for example, the number of pageviews for a given page. Just use the following shortcode: `[slimstat f='count' w='id']content_id equals current[/slimstat]`. You can find more information on our [knowledge base](http://docs.wp-slimstat.com)
* [Update] [Browscap](http://browscap.org/) library updated to version 6014, released on April 21th, 2016.
* [Fix] When the Network Settings add-on was activated and subsequently deactivated, some of the original options would be lost.
* [Fix] Text areas in the settings were not becoming read-only if the corresponding option was set "network wide" via the Network Settings add-on.

= 4.3.1.2 =
* [Update] Activity log entries are now grouped both by IP and by username.
* [Fix] A PHP Warning was being returned by the new Rankings report.

= 4.3.1.1 =
* [Update] [Browscap](http://browscap.org/) library updated to version 6013, released on March 15th, 2016.
* [Fix] Values in textarea setting fields were not being saved.

= 4.3.1 =
* [Note] A few users have pointed out issues upgrading from versions prior to 4.0, which introduced a new table structure (see changelog). About eight months after we released version 4.0, we removed the upgrade script to streamline our codebase and improve performance. Given all these requests for help, we now decided to restore that code, and extend it to include extra checks and warnings, if something goes wrong. Check Settings > Maintenance > Database to see if you have a notice recommending to remove table leftovers from your database.
* [New] A warning will alert administrators if a caching plugin has been detected, so that they remember to configure Slimstat Analytics accordingly.
* [Fix] Some users were getting a 403 Forbidden when trying to access the list of add-ons from our servers.
* [Fix] A PHP Error was being returned by the new Rankings report.
* [Fix] The Top Referring Domains export was missing one column.
* [Fix] A bug in the customizer was preventing the reports from being displayed correctly, under certain circumstances.
* [Fix] PHP warning being displayed in textareas (settings) under certain circumstances (thank you, [Chris](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/in-php-debug-mode-errors-appear-in-textareas))

= 4.3 =
* [Note] To celebrate Slimstat's 10th birthday, we decided to tweak its name, to better reflect what it does. A few users have pointed out over time that it hadn't been easy for them to find our plugin in the repository. With our limited resources, we have been working on giving our work more visibility, and we are convinced that adding the word "Analytics" to the plugin's name is a step in the right direction. In a few months, we hope to reap the benefits of our efforts.
* [New] Please welcome our latest add-on [Author Overview](http://www.wp-slimstat.com/downloads/author-overview/). Now you can see how popular your blog authors are: this add-on will install a new report that tells you the number of pageviews, unique IPs and unique visits generated by the posts authored by each user in your blog. (thank you, [gh0stmichael](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-display-total-unique-views-per-author))
* [Update] [Plugin Update Checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker), the third-party library we use to distribute updates for our premium add-ons, has been updated to version 3.0. In the next few days, we will release a dummy update of our most popular add-ons to give you a chance to verify that everything works as expected. If this is not the case, feel free to contact us to troubleshoot the issue.
* [Update] [AmMap](https://www.amcharts.com/javascript-maps/), the library used to render the world map, has been updated to version 3.19.3, released on February 23, 2016.
* [Update] All language files are now current. Please consider contributing your localization.
* [Update] It turns out our message regarding Keyword Swarm and other fraudulent clones of Slimstat was confusing users. We updated it to better explain what the situation is. (thank you, [Multimastery](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/keyword-swarm-1))
* [Fix] A bug in our heuristic browser detection functionality was triggering a PHP fatal error, in some cases. (thank you, [mkilian](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/typo-in-browscapuadetectorphp))
* [Fix] Updated Rankings API queries (Alexa, Facebook) and replaced Google API with Mozscape's. One of our users pointed out that the Google Backlink count returned by the Google API is not accurate. Please make sure to [get your personal identification codes](https://moz.com/community/join?redirect=/products/api/keys) to access their API.
* [Fix] Changed the language code for our Japanese localization files. Now Slimstat speaks Japanese! (thank you, [Yasui3](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/change-ja_jp-to-ja))
